# JAX-RS + CXF

A minimal server that implements a REST API using JAX-RS standard and Apache CXF implementation.

The goal was personal: I wanted to see how these dependencies worked together.

### Running and calling the server

```shell
./gradlew run
```

```shell
curl -X GET https://localhost:8080/test/
```
